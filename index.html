            Vesak Festival in Sri Lanka
          </div>
          <div class="box main">
            <p>
              <span class="dropcap">V</span>esak is a religious and cultural festival in Sri Lanka. It is celebrated on the day of the full moon in the month of May.<br/>
              Vesak Day is one of the biggest days of the year and is celebrated by Buddhists all over the world. Buddhists commemorate the important
              events that took place in the life of Lord Buddha on this day. First comes the birth of Siddhartha Gautama in Lumbini in Nepal which
              took place under the arbor of Sat trees where queen Mahamaya gave birth to him. The second event was Siddharta Gautam’s supreme attainment
              as the Buddha, the Enlightened One. The third event was Lord Buddha’s Parinibbana over 2500 years ago at Kusinagar.

              <h3>History</h3>
              The decision to agree to celebrate Wesākha as the Buddha’s birthday was formalized at the first conference of the World Fellowship of
              Buddhists held in Sri Lanka in 1950, although festivals at this time in the Buddhist world are a centuries-old tradition.

            <h2>Birth of Siddharta Gautam</h2>
              <p>
              <span>The Siddharth or lord Buddha</span>, the divine creature inquired about five affairs before expiring for the final birth.
                The inquiries are the: right time, right area, right continent, right caste and right mother.Then, as any Buddhists know,
                the fully mindful divine being entered the womb of Queen Mahamaya. A prince was born on a Vesak Poya day to the Queen and King
                Suddhodana and was named Siddhartha, one who has found meaning of existence. The Queen passed away seven days after the prince’s birth.

                <h3>Celebration</h3>
                On Vesak, devout Buddhists and followers alike assemble in their various temples before dawn for the ceremonial and honorable hoisting
                 of the Buddhist flag and the singing of hymns in praise of the holy triple gem: The Buddha, The Dharma (his teachings), and The Sangha
                (his disciples). Devotees may bring simple offerings of flowers, candles and joss-sticks to lay at the feet of their teacher.
                These symbolic offerings are to remind followers that just as the beautiful flowers would wither away after a short while and
                the candles and joss-sticks would soon burn out, so too is life subject to decay and destruction.

              <h2>Attainment as Lord Buddha</h2>
                <p>
                  Gautama Buddha was trained in various mental skills under many teachers, only to get disillusioned that they do not have the truth
                  he looked for. The right way to achieve the truth dawned on him one day. He directed his mind in the path of meditation.
                  Moments later he reached enlightenment and conquered the world of sorrows on Vesak Poya day.

                <h2>Lord Buddha’s Parinibbana</h2>
                <p>
                  80-year old Gotama Buddha then announced His passing away, Parinibbana, would take place on the third watch of the night at Sal grove
                  of Malla royal family, and it happened to be a Vesak Poya day.

            <h2>Bringing happiness to others</h2>
            <p>Celebrating Vesākha (Vesak) also means making special efforts to bring happiness to the unfortunate like the aged, the handicapped and the sick.
            To this day, Buddhists will distribute gifts in cash and kind to various charitable homes throughout the country. Vesākha is also a time for
            great joy and happiness, expressed not by pandering to one’s appetites but by concentrating on useful activities such as decorating and
            illuminating temples, painting and creating exquisite scenes from the life of the Buddha for public dissemination. Devout Buddhists also
            vie with one another to provide refreshments and vegetarian food to followers who visit the temple to pay homage to the Enlightened One.
